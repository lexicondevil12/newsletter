                                      <li>The Network Services Project Management team has been working to consolidate existing sources of site information to create a single, accurate list of all active Adient sites. By comparing and combining information contained in the PRM Plant List
                                          with information from Verizon, Avaya, and various controller site lists, we were able to reach out to all sites in all regions to verify up-to-date site and contact information. Look for the new Adient Site List to be published in early May
                                          along with a Gate Review.</li>

                                          <p>On March 21st, the team successfully added security to the Extranet. All SMB, NetBios, RPC, LDAP, and DNS protocols not covered by the existing TSA between Adient and JCI were disabled. This was a pre-requisite to the final steps below and
                                              no major incidents were reported.</p>

                                          <p>Final separation preparation - The project team sent a list to application and server owners that appear to still have traffic traversing extranet path between Adient and JCI. We have received very little feedback (10%). <strong>The list out one final time. This is your chance to test your applications prior to separation. We encourage you to please test your applications and provide feedback.</strong></p>

                                          <p>Final Testing - On April 22nd, the team will test the removal of the any to any rules. <strong>Application owners will have this LAST CHANCE to test and ensure their applications are not impacted by this change.</strong> Any issues found should
                                              follow the hyper care process below.</p>

                                      <li>Completed implementation of <strong>Cisco SNTC (Smart Net Total Care) Collector</strong>. This tool gives us visibility into network equipment installed across our entire enterprise. Additionally, the SNTC Collector allowed us to identify risks
                                          associated with Cisco Devices that are past Last Day of Support as well as devices that are not under service contracts. Projects to address both of these issues have been initiated.</li>
                                      <li>The team worked with Verizon to determine how many existing circuits are connected to Verizon owned equipment that are not under <strong>LOA (Letter of Agreement)</strong> as well as how many circuits are covered under a legacy JCI LOA. An LOA
                                          allows Verizon to do work on non-Verizon circuits that are connected to Verizon equipment. All circuits have been identified and brought under the new Adient LOA Template.</li>
                                      <li>Completed an analysis of Adient firewalls to establish standard template configuration and identify firewalls with configurations that require remediation.</li>

                                      <li>Reserach and implement a <strong>TEM (Telecom Expense Management)</strong> solution to manage Network invoices, ordering, and equipment inventory.</li>

                                          <p>On March 29 the EMEA Network Services team presented <strong>SolarWinds</strong>, a new network monitoring tool, to the EMEA Business Unit IT. This tool provides network dashboards for all AE facilities globally and contains utilization graphs,
                                              congestion reports, WLAN statistics and more. The tool can be accessed <a href="https://solarwinds.adient.com/Orion/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fOrion%2fSummaryView.aspx">here</a>. Access can be requested by opening an ITSM ticket and assigning
                                              it to /it.co.net-ops.gl queue.</p>

                                          <p>On April 13, the EMEA team presented the results of the PoC (Proof of Concept) for the <strong>zScaler zApp</strong>. zApp is an application that facilitates global cloud-based information security (web browsing) and solves some of the issues
                                              that we are facing with the current internet setup. zApp will not be widely deployed at the moment in Adient but the proof of concept showed advanced technologies that might be reconsidered at a later stage.</p>
